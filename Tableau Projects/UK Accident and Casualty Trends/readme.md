UK Accident and Casualty Trends : In my project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of accident and casualty data spanning three years in the United Kingdom. This analysis encompassed a detailed examination of accident severity, as well as the influence of various factors on accidents and casualties. I meticulously analyzed the data by dissecting accidents and casualties based on vehicle types, weather conditions, road types, light conditions, and locations. Through advanced data analytics techniques, I transformed complex datasets into actionable insights, shedding light on road safety trends and patterns. This United Kingdom Accident and Casualties Analysis project underscores my proficiency in data analysis and visualization, showcasing my ability to uncover meaningful insights within extensive datasets. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of road safety in the UK and provides a foundation for informed policy decisions and safety measures.
